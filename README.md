# Fitness-Calculator


The fitness calculator is based on calculating the value of BMI (Body Mass Index) and VO2max to find out the fitness level of the person. BMI can be used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems but it is not diagnostic of the body fatness or health of an individual. Whereas VO2 max is a measure of the maximum amount of oxygen that you use during intense activity. VO2max measurement determines fitness level by calculating how your cells use oxygen for energy.
